# Dollar-a-Day-Budget-Tool
This tool was created for a charitable campaign where participants would only eat 1 dollar's worth of food per day for 1 week.  
It was incorporated on https://www.dollaraday.global/food, and a sample of the budgeting tool can be found at https://objective-shannon-cb7a73.netlify.com/

IdexedDB was used to save users budgeting work into their browser, so they can continue working at a later date. 

Charts.js was used to create the pie chart representing the total budget.
